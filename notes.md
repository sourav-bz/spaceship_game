Here i am going to write questions on my mind, to write blogs on.

What's ECS? how is different and unique compared to OOPs? why did bevy go with ECS? Maybe show some examples and differences between different paradigms\
What's the basic structure of a given bevy app? what are the important components? and how do you structure it?
What are plugins?
What are commands and queries? and the parameters which are passed and the types of it? when do you know what you gotta use and why?
WHat are resources? and what are the things which can be added to the bevy app?
What's the flow of data from the main app, to plugins, to E,C,S?
Where can I see and visualise all the commands flowing through the systems? like a log or data flow between nodes (entities) something like that?
How are bundles made? why is it required? what are the things which can be included in it? and how does it get passed down to wherever it's going to?
What are queries? and what are the sub fields structs which are accessed and available to use from queries?
What is derive? when is it used? and why is it used? is it like interface in OOPs?
